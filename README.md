# creating-a-totally-new-algorithm-
 Creating a new algorithm involves defining a problem, researching existing methods, and designing a novel, efficient solution. It requires creativity, optimization, and rigorous testing for correctness and scalability. Examples include Dijkstraâ€™s for shortest paths and genetic algorithms inspired by evolution, pushing problem-solving boundaries.
